    "section": "",
    "text": "Emacs does not have a native way in which to increase the line spacing across all documents. As someone that works a lot on large text documents in Emacs I find that text is sometimes just too close together, and having a bit of line spacing makes it much easier to work with long pages of text.\nTo get around the lack of line-spacing support I have created a hacky way to create a new font which includes extra white space above and below the text itself to create the impression of line spacing.\nThis code is taken/derived from: https://github.com/tam5/font-patcher\nFontforge needs to be installed from the website. via brew\nthen you can run this fontforge file.py\n\nimport os\nimport fontforge\n\ninput_file = 'directory/your_font.ttf'\noutput_dir = 'directory/your_new_font.ttf'\n\nfactor = 1.2 # line spacing to add\n\ndef adjust(font, attribute, factor):\n    \"\"\"Adjust an attribute of a font by a given factor.\"\"\"\n    original = getattr(font, attribute)\n    new = int(getattr(font, attribute) * factor)\n\n    setattr(font, attribute, new)\n\n\nfont = fontforge.open(input_file)\n\nprint('')\nfor prop in ['os2_winascent', 'os2_typoascent', 'hhea_ascent']:\n    adjust(font, prop, factor)\n\nfor prop in ['os2_windescent', 'os2_typodescent', 'hhea_descent']:\n    adjust(font, prop, factor * 2)\n\nfor attr in ['fontname', 'familyname', 'fullname']:\n    value = \"{} {}\".format(getattr(font, attr), factor)\n    setattr(font, attr, value)\n\nfont.copyright = \"(c) {} Acme Corp. All Rights Reserved.\"\n\nfilename, extension = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(input_file))\nnewFileName = \"{}Patched {}{}\".format(filename, factor, extension)\n\nsfnt = {}\nfor el in font.sfnt_names:\n    sfnt[el[1]] = el\n\nsfnt[\"UniqueID\"] = ('English (US)', 'UniqueID', font.fontname)\nsfnt[\"Preferred Family\"] = ('English (US)', 'Preferred Family', font.familyname)\n\nfont.sfnt_names = tuple(sfnt.values())\n\nfont.save(output_dir + \"/\" + newFileName)\nfont.generate(output_dir + \"/\" + newFileName)\n\nAnd this is the result:\n\nBefore\n\n\n\nAfter"
